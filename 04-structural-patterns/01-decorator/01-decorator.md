The **Decorator Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Itâ€™s often used as a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### **Real-world Analogy**
A coffee shop:  
- You can order a plain coffee.  
- You can add milk, sugar, whipped cream etc.  
Each "add-on" *wraps* the original coffee and extends its cost/description dynamically.
