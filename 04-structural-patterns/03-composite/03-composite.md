The **Composite Pattern** is a structural design pattern used to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Itâ€™s ideal for representing part-whole hierarchies like trees.

### **Use Cases**
- GUI frameworks (e.g., panels with buttons and text)
- Filesystem hierarchy (files and directories)
- Organization structures (employees and departments)
