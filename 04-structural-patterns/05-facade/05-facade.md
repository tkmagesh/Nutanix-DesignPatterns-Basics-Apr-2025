# Facade

The **Facade Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of complex subsystems. It hides the complexities of the system and provides an easy-to-use interface for the client.

## **Context**
You're building an e-commerce backend. You need to:
- Connect to the database
- Perform queries (fetch, insert, update)
- Do some validations or logging

The **Facade** will simplify all this into one clean interface for clients.
