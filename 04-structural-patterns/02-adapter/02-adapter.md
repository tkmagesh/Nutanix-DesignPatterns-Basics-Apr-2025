The **Adapter Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts like a bridge between two interfaces.

### Real-World Analogy:
A power adapter that allows a two-pronged plug to fit into a three-pronged outlet.

---

### **Intent**
Convert the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.
