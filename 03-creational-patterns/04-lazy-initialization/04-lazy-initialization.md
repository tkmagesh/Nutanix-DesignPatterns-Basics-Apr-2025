**Lazy Initialization** is a design pattern and programming technique where an object or resource is not created or initialized until it is actually needed (i.e., the first time it's accessed). This helps improve performance and reduces resource consumption, especially when the initialization is expensive or the object may not be used at all.

### Key Concepts

- **Deferred creation** of an object.
- **Memory-efficient** and **performance-friendly**, especially in resource-heavy applications.
- Often used in **Singleton**, **Factory**, and **Proxy** patterns.

###  Real-world Analogy

Think of a coffee machine in your office that only starts brewing **when someone presses the button**â€”not at startup. This saves energy and avoids making unneeded coffee.
